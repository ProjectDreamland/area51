No blocks of object allocations

	Allocating objects from a single pool probably isn't feasable if we have 
many object types. Can't simply allocate 1 block of objects because they 
vary in size so we would have to allocate a separate block of objects for 
each final type which would likely result in a large amount of unneeded waste.


Search types

	Trade offs between memory and size can be made by using records which hold
information about the objects in contiguous blocks of memory.  What extra data
goes into these records whill have to be weighed against 




obj_type_info

	Another optimizing structure.  Again, looks like redundant data but this
object is used to turn a "switch" statement with as many cases as there are
object types into an array lookup.


obj_type_node

	For keeping stats on object types.  Only allocated once for each object type
not once for each object.  The following members weren't being used in Meridian.
They were being set and reset but never used.

        s32         TotalInstanceCount;
        f32         LogicTimeMS;
        f32         LogicInnerTimeMS;


obj_slot

	This structure is used for holding all objects in the game.  Holds the GUID,
the type, a pointer to the object, an index to the next and previous for it.
There is a fixed size array of these objects to insure that they are linear.
