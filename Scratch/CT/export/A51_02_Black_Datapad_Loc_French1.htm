    I had no idea. I mean, you come up with a lot<br>
    of theories when you face something like<br>
    this, but I just... I had no idea.<br>
    <br>
    But the more I think about it, the more it<br>
    makes sense. They needed a power source<br>
    that would last aeons. They had no way of<br>
    knowing when or if someone would pick up <br>
    their signal. And even if the signal were <br>
    retrieved, who knows when or if they'd<br>
    come looking? <br>
    <br>
    But the technology involved... I can't even <br>
    imagine. The Grays are much more <br>
    advanced than we ever thought they were.<br>
    And they had this capability 40,000 years<br>
    ago! Imagine what their race has achieved <br>
    since then.<br>

    The power to enslave a star... It's incredible.</td>

    The Higgs theory that the Theta virus is<br>
    a colonization tool rather than a defense<br>
    mechanism has found a great many<br>
    supporters in recent weeks. Our<br>
    mutated research subjects are mindless<br>
    and violent at first, but over time, they start<br>
    to develop basic problem-solving skills.<br>
    We first discovered this on accident when<br>
    the mutants in Cell 4 escaped and did <br>
    what they did to Byrd. No one could figure<br>
    out how these 'animals' were capable of <br>
    such activities, but in the weeks since<br>
    the incident, we've put the mutants through<br>
    several different intelligence tests. <br>
    <br>
    They're getting smarter, though it's a <br>
    different kind of smart. They're not <br>
    smart like humans. They're smart like <br>
    Thetas.<br>
    <br>
    My guess is that if we left them alone long<br>
    enough, they would eventually become<br>
    Thetas.</td>

    reliable proof of cold fusion in six months. <br>
    <br>
    I also made sure to fudge some of their<br>
    previous test results in order to make it <br>
    appear that their results were doctored.<br>
    When their research is made public, I'll<br>
    direct our people at the magazines to the<br>
    doctored results. <br>
    <br>
    If all proceeds smoothly, we'll have <br>
