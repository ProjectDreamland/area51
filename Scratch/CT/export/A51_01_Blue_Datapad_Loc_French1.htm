    anyway, this place is somewhat <br>
    technologically advanced if you hadn't<br>
    notivced. even if their little virus work<br>
    gets out of hand, i'm sure we're all right. <br>

    <br>
    The virus is real. And that's not even the <br>
    worst of it. According to one of the guys<br>
    in Black - and I can't tell you who he is -<br>
    the virus is &quot;alien in origin.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Now, what the hell does that mean? I don't<br>
    know. Does he mean &quot;alien&quot; as in Mexican <br>
    or something? Or does he mean &quot;ALIEN?&quot;<br>
