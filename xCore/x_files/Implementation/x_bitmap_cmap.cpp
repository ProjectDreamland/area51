/*****************************************************************
 * TAG( inv_cmap_2 )
 *
 * Compute an inverse colormap efficiently.
 * Inputs:
 * 	colors:		Number of colors in the forward colormap.
 * 	colormap:	The forward colormap.
 * 	bits:		Number of quantization bits.  The inverse
 * 			colormap will have (2^bits)^3 entries.
 * 	dist_buf:	An array of (2^bits)^3 long integers to be
 * 			used as scratch space.
 * Outputs:
 * 	rgbmap:		The output inverse colormap.  The entry
 * 			rgbmap[(r<<(2*bits)) + (g<<bits) + b]
 * 			is the colormap entry that is closest to the
 * 			(quantized) color (r,g,b).
 * Assumptions:
 * 	Quantization is performed by right shift (low order bits are
 * 	truncated).  Thus, the distance to a quantized color is
 * 	actually measured to the color at the center of the cell
 * 	(i.e., to r+.5, g+.5, b+.5, if (r,g,b) is a quantized color).
 * Algorithm:
 * 	Uses a "distance buffer" algorithm:
 * 	The distance from each representative in the forward color map
 * 	to each point in the rgb space is computed.  If it is less
 * 	than the distance currently stored in dist_buf, then the
 * 	corresponding entry in rgbmap is replaced with the current
 * 	representative (and the dist_buf entry is replaced with the
 * 	new distance).
 *
 * 	The distance computation uses an efficient incremental formulation.
 *
 * 	Distances are computed "outward" from each color.  If the
 * 	colors are evenly distributed in color space, the expected
 * 	number of cells visited for color I is N^3/I.
 * 	Thus, the complexity of the algorithm is O(log(K) N^3),
 * 	where K = colors, and N = 2^bits.
 */

/*
 * Here's the idea:  scan from the "center" of each cell "out"
 * until we hit the "edge" of the cell -- that is, the point
 * at which some other color is closer -- and stop.  In 1-D,
 * this is simple:
 * 	for i := here to max do
 * 		if closer then buffer[i] = this color
 * 		else break
 * 	repeat above loop with i := here-1 to min by -1
 *
 * In 2-D, it's trickier, because along a "scan-line", the
 * region might start "after" the "center" point.  A picture
 * might clarify:
 *		 |    ...
 *               | ...	.
 *              ...    	.
 *           ... |      .
 *          .    +     	.
 *           .          .
 *            .         .
 *             .........
 *
 * The + marks the "center" of the above region.  On the top 2
 * lines, the region "begins" to the right of the "center".
 *
 * Thus, we need a loop like this:
 * 	detect := false
 * 	for i := here to max do
 * 		if closer then
 * 			buffer[..., i] := this color
 * 			if !detect then
 * 				here = i
 * 				detect = true
 * 		else
 * 			if detect then
 * 				break
 *
 * Repeat the above loop with i := here-1 to min by -1.  Note that
 * the "detect" value should not be reinitialized.  If it was
 * "true", and center is not inside the cell, then none of the
 * cell lies to the left and this loop should exit
 * immediately.
 *
 * The outer loops are similar, except that the "closer" test
 * is replaced by a call to the "next in" loop; its "detect"
 * value serves as the test.  (No assignment to the buffer is
 * done, either.)
 *
 * Each time an outer loop starts, the "here", "min", and
 * "max" values of the next inner loop should be
 * re-initialized to the center of the cell, 0, and cube size,
 * respectively.  Otherwise, these values will carry over from
 * one "call" to the inner loop to the next.  This tracks the
 * edges of the cell and minimizes the number of
 * "unproductive" comparisons that must be made.
 *
 * Finally, the inner-most loop can have the "if !detect"
 * optimized out of it by splitting it into two loops: one
 * that finds the first color value on the scan line that is
 * in this cell, and a second that fills the cell until
 * another one is closer:
 *  	if !detect then	    {needed for "down" loop}
 * 	    for i := here to max do
 * 		if closer then
 * 			buffer[..., i] := this color
 * 			detect := true
 * 			break
 *	for i := i+1 to max do
 *		if closer then
 * 			buffer[..., i] := this color
 * 		else
 * 			break
 *
 * In this implementation, each level will require the
 * following variables.  Variables labelled (l) are local to each
 * procedure.  The ? should be replaced with r, g, or b:
 *  	cdist:	    	The distance at the starting point.
 * 	?center:	The value of this component of the color
 *  	c?inc:	    	The initial increment at the ?center position.
 * 	?stride:	The amount to add to the buffer
 * 			pointers (dp and rgbp) to get to the
 * 			"next row".
 * 	min(l):		The "low edge" of the cell, init to 0
 * 	max(l):		The "high edge" of the cell, init to
 * 			colormax-1
 * 	detect(l):    	True if this row has changed some
 * 	    	    	buffer entries.
 *  	i(l): 	    	The index for this row.
 *  	?xx:	    	The accumulated increment value.
 *
 *  	here(l):    	The starting index for this color.  The
 *  	    	    	following variables are associated with here,
 *  	    	    	in the sense that they must be updated if here
 *  	    	    	is changed.
 *  	?dist:	    	The current distance for this level.  The
 *  	    	    	value of dist from the previous level (g or r,
 *  	    	    	for level b or g) initializes dist on this
 *  	    	    	level.  Thus gdist is associated with here(b)).
 *  	?inc:	    	The initial increment for the row.

 *  	?dp:	    	Pointer into the distance buffer.  The value
 *  	    	    	from the previous level initializes this level.
 *  	?rgbp:	    	Pointer into the rgb buffer.  The value
 *  	    	    	from the previous level initializes this level.
 *
 * The blue and green levels modify 'here-associated' variables (dp,
 * rgbp, dist) on the green and red levels, respectively, when here is
 * changed.
