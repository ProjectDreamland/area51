<tr valign=top><td><p>A:</p></td><td><p>There are a few things you can do to minimize the glitch, but looped MP3s always glitch a little - <b>always</b>. The issue is that the MP3 file format uses a 50% frame overlap in each compressed frame. That means you can't just plug one MP3 frame up next to another - you get a big blip of odd synthesized audio when the decoder merges two completely unrelated chunks of data. </p><p>To avoid this, Miles clears the MP3 decoder whenever the audio loops (either at the end of the file or at the end of a sub-loop block). This always kicks out a short blip of silence in the output. <b>This is as good as MP3 can be looped</b> - there is no way to improve it - it's just a downside to the format itself. </p><p>So, you can't get any better than a little blip of silence, however, you can accidentally make it <b>even worse</b> when using bad sub-block loop points. To avoid this, make sure the loop points that you choose occur at the beginning of a new MP3 frame. Most sound editors can display the frame points of an MP3 file. </p></td></tr>
