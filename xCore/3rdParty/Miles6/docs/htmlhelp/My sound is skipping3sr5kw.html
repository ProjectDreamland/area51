<tr valign=top><td><p>A:</p></td><td><p>Under Win32, mixing happens on a background thread (on the other Miles platforms, mixing occurs on an interrupt). Unlike interrupts, threads are subject to starvation - that is, depending on CPU load, one thread can be neglected for a period of time. </p><p>When that happens to the Miles mixing thread, then the digital audio can "skip" momentarily. Fortunately, on NT based Win32 platforms, this rarely happens - you really have to try to cause a skip on NT. Unfortunately, on the Windows 9x based platforms, it is fairly easy to cause the Miles thread to starve. The easiest way to trigger starvation is to do a lot of sustained disk IO on an IDE-based device. </p><p>So, regardless of the cause of the problem, we just want the user to have a good experience. A simple way to fix the problem is to just mix ahead farther - if we mix ahead 200 milliseconds, then we can tolerate a thread dropout of up to 200 ms with no trouble! The only problem is that now our latency is 200 ms - fine for some games, but terrible for others! </p><p>Fortunately, there is a good compromise. By using the <a href="AIL_get_timer_highesqwlaaa.html">AIL_get_timer_highest_delay</a> function, you can track the length of the thread starvations as they occur. </p><p>So, let's say you have a game that skips when you read in the level data from the disk. The best way to fix the problem is something like this: </p><p>1) Call <a href="AIL_get_timer_highesqwlaaa.html">AIL_get_timer_highest_delay</a> before you start the IO (this clears the previous high value). </p><p>2) Do all your IO. </p><p>3) Call <a href="AIL_get_timer_highesqwlaaa.html">AIL_get_timer_highest_delay</a> and record it. </p><p>Run your game on a couple machines and keep track of the high value. It's usually going to be something around 150 milliseconds, but get a good reading with your game's pattern of IO. </p><p>Now we just bump up the latency during the IO and then bump it back down after - you get the best of both worlds - good latency in the general case, and enough mix ahead to handle the IO dropouts. Once you know roughly what latency you have to cover, simply do something like this: </p><p>1) Call <a href="AIL_set_preference.html">AIL_set_preference</a> on <a href="MILES_PREFERENCES.html#DIG_DS_MIX_FRAGMENT_CNT">DIG_DS_MIX_FRAGMENT_CNT</a> to your highest timer delay divided by 8 (each fragment in Miles is 8 ms). </p><p>2) Call <a href="AIL_serve.html">AIL_serve</a> to make sure that the mix-ahead buffer is filled. </p><p>3) Do all your IO. </p><p>4) Call <a href="AIL_set_preference.html">AIL_set_preference</a> on <a href="MILES_PREFERENCES.html#DIG_DS_MIX_FRAGMENT_CNT">DIG_DS_MIX_FRAGMENT_CNT</a> to set it back to its default value of 8. </p></td></tr>
