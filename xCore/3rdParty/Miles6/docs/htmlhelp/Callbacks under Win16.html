<h1>Callbacks under Win16</h1>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Read this section carefully if you plan to use Miles timer or other callbacks (such as an end-of-sample callback). If you don't intend to use callbacks, then this section won't apply to you. </p><p>Under Win16, callbacks are usually made to your application on a Windows multimedia timer callback. Multimedia timer callbacks are the Windows equivalent to a DOS interrupt. The ideal callback function is one that does nothing more than writes to one or two flag variables and then immediately returns back to Miles. </p><p>The most important thing to remember is you can't call most Windows functions inside a multimedia timer. I/O is <b>especially</b> not allowed! </p><p>All code and data accessed by the callback function should reside in a FIXED segment (you set this in your project's DEF file). Make sure that all data passed to Miles is allocated from <a href="AIL_mem_alloc_lock.html">AIL_mem_alloc_lock</a> function. </p><p>Also remember that all global or static variables that are modified by a callback function must be declared with the <i>volatile</i> modifier. Otherwise, the callback function and the foreground may not be able to communicate after the compiler has performed all of its optimizing tricks. </p><p>You should also minimize the total amount of work inside a Miles callback. During a callback, Miles is suspended, so other background tasks won't run - mixing will be interrupted, for example, if you take too long. </p><p>Again, though, the best advice for callbacks is to simply post a message or set a flag that can be operated on by your foreground task. This technique works on all platforms and you'll never need to worry about the complications that multithreading can cause. </p>
