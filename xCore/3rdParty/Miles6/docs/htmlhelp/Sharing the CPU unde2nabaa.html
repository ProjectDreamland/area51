<h1>Sharing the CPU under Win32</h1>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Under Win32, Miles does most of its work in a background thread. This means that Miles usually does its work without you even having to worry about it. The mixing and buffer submission to the sound hardware all happens without your intervention. </p><p>The only time you may need to specifically give Miles CPU time is if the system thread scheduler starts performing badly and the background Miles thread starves. Under the Windows 95, 98, and Me, the thread scheduler usually has the most trouble when performing disk I/O. </p><p>Miles provides several techniques to handle thread-starvation. See the <a href="AIL_get_timer_highesqwlaaa.html">AIL_get_timer_highest_delay</a> function as well as the "My sound is skipping - what can I do?" <i><a href="My sound is skipping3sr5kw.html#FAQ">FAQ</a></i> for more details. </p>
