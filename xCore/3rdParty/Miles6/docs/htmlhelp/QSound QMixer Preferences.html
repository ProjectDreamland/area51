<h1>QSound QMixer Preferences</h1>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p> This provider supplies the full QSound QMixer technology inside the Miles Sound System. Note, however, that this provider is licensed separately from the Miles Sound System. If you wish to ship the QMixer provider, you must obtain a separate license from QSound (they do charge for this license) - contract RAD for all the details. The evaluation QMixer provider is covered by the End User License Agreement on the next page. </p><p>The QSound provider publishes several provider-level and sample-level preferences (for setting) and attributes (for reading). The easiest way to determine if you are using the QSound M3D provider is to query the "QSound Technology Version" attribute. If this query returns a value other than -1, then you know that you are running under QSound. </p><p><b>The current QSound provider-level preferences are:</b> </p><p><b>"Qsound technology version":</b> this read-only attribute returns the version of the underlying QMixer DLL. This attribute returns 32-bit integer (S32). </p><p><b>"Crossover filter":</b> this preference apply a crossover filter to improve the low frequency response for localized sounds (especially on sub-woofer systems), at the cost of greater CPU usage and a slight reduction in positioning effectiveness near +/- 90°azimuth. This preference accepts a 32-bit integer (S32) - zero for false, non-zero for true. </p><p><b>"Swap output channels":</b> this preference controls Swap left and right output channels. This preference accepts a 32-bit integer (S32) - zero for not swapped, non-zero for swapped. </p><p><b>"Rear of listener effects":</b> this preference controls whether 3D effects are applied to samples behind the listener. This preference accepts a 32-bit integer (S32) - zero for false, non-zero for true. </p><p><b>The current QSound sample-level preferences are:</b> </p><p><b>"Processing mode flags":</b> this sample-level preference controls how each sample is processed. See the Qsound documentation for the <i>QsoundSetChannelParams</i> function for more details on this preference. This preference accepts a 32-bit integer (S32). </p><p><b>END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR QSOUND PLUG-IN SOFTWARE FOR MILES SOUND SYSTEM</b> </p><p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE: QSOUND PLUG-IN SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED FOR EVALUATION PURPOSES ONLY.
