<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p> <br> <br> Welcome to the Miles Sound System! </p><p>The Miles Sound System has been the standard in video game audio for almost ten years now. Ten years! It always surprises me to remember that Miles started out before Windows 3.0, before the Mac went to PowerPC, way before even the plain old Pentium chip! </p><p>Somehow, it just makes sense that on its tenth anniversary in 2001, Miles will be shipping on more platforms than ever! We've added MacOS support for the surprisingly resurrected Macintosh market and we're working on console platforms for next year. I guess I shouldn't be surprised to see Miles still going strong in other ten years! </p><p>After ten years of development, Miles has incorporated pretty much everything that related to game audio. Name a technology and it is in there somewhere - digital, MIDI, 3D, DSP, MP3, redbook and more! </p><p>This documentation will help you get a handle on these various APIs. We spend quite a bit of time working on our docs and hope they get you up and running fast. Please give us feedback on what worked for you and what didn't. Just as with the Miles API itself, we strive for continual improvement in our documentation as well. Your feedback is crucial in this regard! </p><p>Documentation is a pain to read when you just want to get up and running quickly. RAD realizes this, so we've retooled our docs to be more focused on specific tasks and problems. Really, the only documentation that you should force yourself to read is the <b>Overview</b> for your game's platform, and the "<b>FAQs and How Tos</b>" <i><a href="FAQs and How Tos.html#Section">Section</a></i>. </p><p>The "FAQs and How Tos" section is the best way to learn about using Miles - there are lots of "getting started" FAQs as well as tons of hard won trouble-shooting FAQs as well. </p><p>I love these new FAQs actually - I think it's a much more effective way to learn the ins and outs of a product than poring over a reference manual - I hope you like them too! </p><p>Also, note that our printed documentation doesn't include the Miles Reference Guide (function, type and preference descriptions - over 600 additional pages). Check out the online documentation for fully hyper-linked and cross-referenced discussions - it's awesome! </p><p>Again, please send feedback to me as you use Miles - what confused you, what you liked, what you hated, what you'd like to see in future versions, etc. Your feedback is what keeps Miles vital, fun to use, and powerful after all these years! </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>Jeff Roberts - RAD Game Tools - <a href="mailto:miles@radgametools.com">E-mail</a>. </p>
