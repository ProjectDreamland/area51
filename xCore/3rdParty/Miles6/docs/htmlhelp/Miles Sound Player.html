<h1>Miles Sound Player</h1>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p> The Miles Sound Player is an easy-to-use application for Win32 and Win16 that can play PCM wave files, IMA ADPCM wave files, MPEG Layer 3 files, MIDI files, and XMIDI files. It can play any of the MIDI types with the system's MIDI hardware or with the MSS software synthesizer. The Miles Sound Player is available for Windows or MacOS. </p><p>This application is launched from the Miles Sound Studio when you choose to play a sound file. </p><p><b>Controls:</b> </p><p>The <b>slider</b> allows you to both view and change the current playback position. </p><p>The <b>CPU</b> indicator tells you what percentage of the CPU is being used by the digital processor and/or software synthesizer. </p><p>The <b>Filter</b> switch turns on and off sound filtering - filtering takes a little extra CPU time. </p><p>The <b>Reverb</b> switch turns on and off global reverb - reverb also takes extra CPU time. </p><p>The <b>Rate</b> pull down allows you to choose the rate for digital synthesis - the faster the rate, the more CPU time is required. </p><p>The <b>16-bit</b> switch turns on and off 16-bit output mode - 16-bit quality takes very little extra CPU time. </p><p>The <b>Stereo</b> switch turns on and off stereo output mode - stereo takes extra CPU time. </p><p>The <b>MIDI</b> pull down allows you to choose five different MIDI playback options: </p><p><b>"Auto-choose MIDI device":</b> tells the player to use the system MIDI hardware for normal MIDI and XMIDI sequences, and to use the software-synthesizer for XMIDI files with embedded DLS data. </p><p><b>"Use MIDI hardware":</b> tells the player to use the system MIDI hardware in all cases. </p><p><b>"Use software synthesizer":</b> tells the player to use the Miles software synthesizer in all cases. </p><p><b>"Use Vortex DLS hardware":</b> tells the player to use the Aureal Vortex DLS hardware for playback. </p><p><b>"Use SonicVibes DLS hardware":</b> tells the player to use the S3 SonicVibes DLS hardware for playback. To use the software synthesizer with normal MIDI and XMIDI sequences, you must also choose a DLS file as the instrument set - click the <b>"GM DLS file..."</b> button to choose this DLS file. </p>
