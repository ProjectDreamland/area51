<tr valign=top><td><p>A:</p></td><td><p>It doesn't. Philosophically, RAD has never been a big fan of handling sound prioritization at the library level. The way Miles works, the application can just allocate sample handles until it hits the system-imposed limit, and the application is responsible for reusing those handles in whatever way it sees fit. The application can use whatever criteria it wants to bump playing sounds (age, importance, distance, volume, etc.), or decide not to bump any at all if the new sound isn't that important. </p><p>A lot of that flexibility goes away, or becomes awkward to access, if you make Miles responsible for killing existing sounds in favor of new ones. </p><p></p></td></tr>
