# Area 51 (2005) Source Code

## Building PC Build

The following prerequisites are required to build the source tree for PC:

1. Visual Studio .Net 2003
2. XtremeToolkit 4100 | Install it from "xCore\3rdParty\CodeJock"
3. You'll need to create an environment variable called **X** and **S** that points to the important library directions of the source tree. For example, if the source tree is located at 'D:\area51-pc' the **X** environment variable should point to 'D:\area51-pc\xCore'. the **S** environment variable should point to 'D:\area51-pc\Support'

At the moment, only a 8 tools are functioning. Game build doesn't work. Valid build targets are: Debug Win32. Retail/Relase Win32 is temporary broken.
