# Area 51 (2005) Source Code

## Building PC Build

The following prerequisites are required to build the source tree for PC:

1. Visual Studio .Net 2003
3. You'll need to create an environment variable called **X** that points to the xCore directory of the source tree. For example, if the source tree is located at 'D:\area51-pc' the **X** environment variable should point to 'D:\area51-pc\xCore'.

At the moment, only a few tools are functioning. Game build doesn't work. Valid build targets are: Debug WIin32. Retail/Relase WIin32 is temporary broken.
