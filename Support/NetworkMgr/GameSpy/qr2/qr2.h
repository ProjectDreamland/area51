passed to this function.

/************
QR2_INIT
--------
This function initializes the Query and Reporting SDK and prepares the SDK to accept incoming
queries and send heartbeats to the master server.
[qrec] if not null, will be filled with the qr2_t instance for this server.
    If you are not using more than one instance of the Query & Reporting SDK you
    can pass in NULL for this value.
[ip] is an optional parameter that determines which dotted IP address to bind to on
    a multi-homed machine. You can pass NULL to bind to all IP addresses.
    If your game networking supports binding to user-specified IPs, you should make sure the same IP
    is bound by the Query and Reporting SDK.
[baseport] is the port to accept queries on. If baseport is not available, the
    Query and Reporting SDK will scan for an available port in the range of 
    baseport -> baseport + NUM_PORTS_TO_TRY
    Optionally, you can pass in 0 to have a port chosen automatically
    (makes it harder for debugging/testing).
[gamename] is the unique gamename that you were given
[secretkey] is your unique secret key
[ispublic] is 1 if the server should send heartbeats to the GameSpy master server and be publicly listed, 
    If 0, the server will only be available for LAN browsing
[natnegotiate] is 1 if the server supports GameSpy's NAT-negotiation technology (or another similar technology)
     which allows hosting behind a NAT. If you do not support NAT-negotiation (i.e. a 3rd party handshake server), 
     pass 0 to prevent the server from being listed if it is behind a NAT that cannot be traversed by outside clients.
[qr2_*_callback] are your callback functions, these cannot be NULL
[userdata] is an optional, implementation specific parameter that will be
    passed to all callback functions. Use it to store an object or structure
    pointer if needed.

Returns
e_qrnoerror is successful, otherwise one of the qr2_error_t constants above.

QR2_INIT_SOCKET
--------
This version of qr2_init allows the game to specify the UDP socket to use for
sending heartbeats and query replies. This enables the game and the QR2 SDK to
share a single UDP socket for all networking, which can make hosting games
behind a NAT proxy possible (see the documentation for more information).
You must also use qr2_parse_query to pass in any data received for the QR SDK
on the socket, since the SDK will not try to read any data off the socket directly.
[s] is the UDP socket to use for heartbeats and query replies. It must be a valid
    socket and should be bound to a port before calling qr_init_socket. It can be
    blocking or non-blocking.
[boundport] is the local port that the socket is bound to.
All other parameters are the same as described in qr2_init.

function whenever data is received. 
Unless you are using multiple instances of the SDK, you should pass NULL

for qrec.

QR2_SHUTDOWN
------------
This function closes the sockets created in qr_init and takes care of
any misc. cleanup. You should try to call it when before exiting the server process.
An "exiting" statechanged heartbeat will automatically be sent to assist in quickly
de-listing the server.
If you pass in a qrec that was returned from qr_init, all resources associated
with that qrec will be freed. If you passed NULL into qr_int, you can pass
NULL in here as well.
