/********
InitStatsConnection

DESCRIPTION
Opens a connection to the stats server. Should be done before calling
NewGame or any of the bucket/snapshot functions. May block for 1-2 secs
while the connection is established so you will want to do this before
gameplay starts or in another thread.

PARAMETERS
gameport: integer port associated with your server (may be the same as
    your developer spec query port). Used only to help players differentiate
    between servers on the same machine (no queries are done on it). If not
    appropriate for your game, pass in 0.

RETURNS
GE_NODNS: Unable to resolve stats server DNS
GE_NOSOCKET: Unable to create data socket
GE_NOCONNECT: Unable to connect to stats server
GE_DATAERROR: Unable to receive challenge from stats server, or bad challenge
GE_NOERROR: Connected to stats server and ready to send data

Note: You can still call ANY of the other Stats SDK functions, even if the
connection fails. If you have disk logging enabled, these calls will be logged
for future sending, otherwise they will be discarded.
*********/

/********
IsStatsConnected

DESCRIPTION
Returns whether or not you are currently connected to the stats server. Even
if your initial connection was successful, you may lose connection later and
want to try to reconnnect

RETURNS
1 if connected, 0 otherwise
*********/
int IsStatsConnected();

/********
CloseStatsConnection

DESCRIPTION
Closes the connection to the stats server. You should do this when done
with the connection.
*********/
void CloseStatsConnection(void);

/********
GetChallenge

DESCRIPTION
Returns a string that should be sent to clients for authentication
(using GenerateAuth). You do not have to free the string when done.
This string will be constant for the entire length of the game and is
generated during the call to NewGame.

PARAMETERS
game: Game to return the challenge string for. If game is NULL, the last
    game created with NewGame will be used.

RETURNS
A string to send to clients so they can authorize. If you game is NULL and
you haven't created a game with NewGame, it returns "NULLGAME".
*********/
char *GetChallenge(statsgame_t game);

/********
GenerateAuth

DESCRIPTION
Should be used on the CLIENT SIDE to generate an authentication reply
(auth_N) for a given challenge and password (CD Key or Profile password)

PARAMETERS
challenge: The challenge string sent by the server. On the server this
    should be generated with GetChallenge
password: The CD Key (un-hashed) or profile password
response: The output authentication string

RETURNS
A pointer to response
*********/
char *GenerateAuth(char *challenge, gsi_char *password,/*[out]*/char response[33]);

/********
NewGame

DESCRIPTION
Creates a new game for logging and registers it with the stats server. 
Creates all the game structures, including buckets if needed.

PARAMETERS
usebuckets: Set to 1 for bucket based logging, 0 if you are going to create
    the snapshots yourself. See the SDK for more info.

RETURNS
A pointer to the new game. If you are not connected, and disk logging is
disabled, this will be NULL. You can still pass NULL to any function without
causing any errors.
Note: The last game created by NewGame is stored internally. 
If you only create / use one game at a time, you can simply discard
the return value and pass NULL for game into all of the bucket and snapshot functions.
*********/
statsgame_t NewGame(int usebuckets);

/********
FreeGame

DESCRIPTION
Frees a game and its associated structures (including buckets). You should
send a final snapshot for the game (using SendGameSnapShot with SNAP_FINAL)
before freeing the game.

PARAMETERS
game: The game you want to free. If set to NULL, it will free the last
    game created with NewGame.
*********/
void FreeGame(statsgame_t game);

/********
SendGameSnapShot

DESCRIPTION
Sends a snapshot of information about the current game. If bucket based
logging is enabled the snapshot will be generated from the buckets, otherwise
you should provide it in "snapshot". 

PARAMETERS
game: The game to send a snapshot for. If set to NULL, the last game
    created with NewGame will be used.
snapshot: The snapshot to send. If you are using buckets, this will not be
    used, so you can pass in NULL
final: If this is SNAP_UPDATE, the game is marked as in progress, if it
    is SNAP_FINAL, the game is marked as complete.

RETURNS
GE_DATAERROR: If game is NULL and the last game created by NewGame failed
    (because the connection was lost and disk logging is disabled)
GE_NOCONNECT: If the connection is lost and disk logging is disabled
GE_NOERROR: The update was sent, or disk logging is enabled and the game was logged
*********/
int SendGameSnapShot(statsgame_t game, const gsi_char *snapshot, int final);

/******************************
BUCKET FUNCTION PROTOTYPES
These functions are only used for bucket-based logging
*******************************/

/********
Bucket_____Op

DESCRIPTION
Performs an operation on a bucket for a game. If the bucket doesn't exist already,
the call will set the bucket to whatever "value" is. 
You can always create each bucket explicitly by using bo_set with whatever initial
value you want the bucket to have.
Valid operations include set, add, subtract, multiply, divide, concat, and average.
Each bucket type (int, float, or string) has its own operation function, always call
the same one for each bucket (i.e. don't create a bucket with BucketIntOp then try to
add a float with BucketFloatOp).

PARAMETERS
game: The game to send containing the bucket you want to operate on. 
    If set to NULL, the last game created with NewGame will be used.
name: The name of the bucket to update. Note that for player or team buckets, this name
    does NOT include the "_" or "_t" (e.g. "score" for player score, not "score_N"). The underscore
    and number will be added automatically.
operation: One of the bucketop_t enums defined above
value: Argument for the operation (bucket OP= value, e.g. bucket += value, bucket *= value)
bucketlevel: One of the bucketlevel_t enums defined above. Determines whether you are
    referring to a server, player, or team bucket. Note that you can have seperate buckets of
    each type with the same name (e.g. "score" player bucket for each player and "score" team
    bucket for each team)
index: For player or team buckets, the game index of the player or team (as passed to NewPlayer or
    NewTeam). This will be translated to the actual index internally. 
    Not used for server buckets (bl_server).
*********/
#define BucketIntOp(game, name, operation, value, bucketlevel, index) (((SetIntFunc)bopfuncs[bucketlevel][bt_int])(game,name,bucketfuncs[operation],value,index) )
#define BucketFloatOp(game, name, operation, value, bucketlevel, index) (((SetFloatFunc)bopfuncs[bucketlevel][bt_float])(game,name,bucketfuncs[operation],value,index) )

/********
NewPlayer

DESCRIPTION
Adds a "player" to the game and assigns them an internal player number. Sets
their connect time to the number of seconds since NewGame was called.

PARAMETERS
game: The game to add the player to. If set to NULL, the last game created
    with NewGame will be used. 
pnum: Your internal reference for this player, use this value in any calls
    to the Bucket___Op functions.
name: The name for this player. If you don't have one yet, set it to empty ("")
    then call: BucketStringOp(game,"player",bo_set,realplayername, bl_player, pnum)
    when you get a realplayername.
**********/
void NewPlayer(statsgame_t game,int pnum, gsi_char *name);

/********
RemovePlayer

DESCRIPTION
Removes a "player" from the game and sets their disconnect time to the
number of seconds since NewGame was called.

PARAMETERS
game: The game to remove the player from. If set to NULL, the last game created
    with NewGame will be used. 
pnum: Your internal reference for this player, use this value in any calls
    to the Bucket___Op functions.
**********/

/*********
NewTeam
RemoveTeam

DESCRIPTION
See the player functions above. These function the same, except for teams
**********/
void NewTeam(statsgame_t game,int tnum, gsi_char *name);
void RemoveTeam(statsgame_t game,int tnum);

/*********
GetPlayerIndex
GetTeamIndex

DESCRIPTION
Gets the gstats reference number for that player or team. For
example, if you start the game and players 0, 1, and 2 join, then player 1
leaves, and another player 1 joins, the new player 1 will be referenced 
by gstats as 3. If player 3 joins, it will be referenced as player 4, and so on.
Normally this doesn't matter to you, but if you want to do a key name or key value
that references a player or team number (for example, setting a player's team number),
you need to use the translated values. 

PARAMETERS
game: The game to retrieve the translated value for. If set to NULL,the last game created
    with NewGame will be used.
pnum/tnum: Your internal player or team number (as sent to NewTeam/NewPlayer)
